[[topbeat-getting-started]]
== Getting started

Topbeat helps you monitor the availability of your website or service by providing system wide and per process
statistics together with disk space overview.

Get started with your own Topbeat setup by: 

 * installing Elasticsearch for storage and indexing the data. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#elasticsearch-installation[Follow steps]
 * installing Kibana for the UI. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#kibana-installation[Follow steps]
 * installing optionally Logstash. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#logstash-installation[Follow steps]

After you have Elasticsearch, Kibana and optionally Logstash installed, you can start <<topbeat-installation>>.


=== Installing Elasticsearch

https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] is used for storing and indexing 
the infrastructure metrics collected by Topbeat. {libbeat}/getting-started.html#elasticsearch-installation[Follow the
Installation Guide]


=== Optionally install Logstash

https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash] enters the picture by  
{libbeat}/getting-started.html#logstash-installation[Follow the Installation Guide]

=== Installing Topbeat


deb:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i topbeat_{version}_amd64.deb
------------------------------------------------



rpm:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -vi topbeat-{version}-x86_64.rpm
------------------------------------------------


mac:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/topbeat/topbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
tar xzvf topbeat-{version}-darwin.tgz
------------------------------------------------

NOTE: We also provide 32bits images. You can get them from our
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/topbeat[download page].

Before starting topbeat, have a look at the configuration options from `/etc/topbeat/topbeat.yml`, 
described in the next chapter.

[[topbeat-configuration]]
=== Topbeat configuration

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
input:
  period: 10
  procs: [".*"]
-------------------------------------

`period` defines how often to read system wide and per process statistics from your servers. The interval is in seconds. 
By default, it's set to 10 seconds.

`procs` defines a list of regular expressions to match all the processes that need to be monitored. By default, all the running processes are monitored.

If you are not interested in monitoring your processes, then you can use:

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
input:
  period: 10
  procs: ["^$"]
-------------------------------------

[[topbeat-template]]
=== Load index template in Elasticsearch

Before starting topbeat, you need to load the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html[index
template], which is used to let Elasticsearch know which fields should be analyzed
in which way.

The recommended template file is installed by the Topbeat packages. Load it with the
following command:

deb or rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/topbeat' -d@/etc/topbeat/topbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd topbeat-{version}-darwin
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/topbeat' -d@topbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

where `localhost:9200` is the IP and port where Elasticsearch is listening on.

=== Running Topbeat

You are now ready to start Topbeat:

deb:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./topbeat -e -c topbeat.yml -d "publish"
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Check if your servers statistics are present in Elasticsearch:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/topbeat-*/_search?pretty'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to replace `localhost:9200` with the address of your Elasticsearch
instance. 

=== Sample dashboards

In order to make it as easy as possible to start monitoring your servers in Kibana, 
we provide a few sample Kibana dashboards. The dashboards are maintained in this
https://github.com/elastic/beats-dashboards[GitHub repository], which also
includes instructions for loading them.

Load automatically all the sample dashboards in Kibana by following the {libbeat}/getting-started.html#load-kibana-dashboards[steps].

These dashboards are provided as examples, we recommend that you
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html[customize] them
to your needs.

==== System wide overview

You can configure the `Dashboard` page to show the statistics that you are interested in for all the servers or for a
subset of them.
An example of a dashboard page can consist of CPU usage and memory consumption for the top 10 CPU consuming processes
running on different servers, free and used disk space for all servers, the CPU usage per processes, memory consumption per processes.

image:./images/topbeat-dashboard-example.png[Topbeat Dashboard page in Kibana]

==== Per server overview

To display the statistics coming from a single server, a search query like *shipper: precise32* can be used:

You can learn more about Kibana in the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html[Kibana User Guide].


Enjoy!
